Developing a Server with Express (Node.js Framework) and MongoDB using Mongoose (ODM).
Express its a good one cause a give me possibilities to handle with HTTP requests creating Middleware Functions. Therefore, i can create a CRUD API to manipulate data.

Finnaly, I choosed Moongose to create an Database Abstraction, and use Models to create my Schemas.
