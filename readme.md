Developing a Server with Express (Node.js Framework) and MongoDB using Mongoose (ODM).

Express its a good one cause a give me possibilities to handle with HTTP requests creating Middleware Functions. Therefore, i can create a CRUD API to manipulate data.

About Database, I choosed MongoDB its fast to initialize a project, and it's my first time usign a NoSQL Database.
Finnaly, I choosed Moongose to create an Database Abstraction, and use Models to create my Schemas.
